      <h1>Lady Cassandra</h1>
      <p>Portrayed by <b>Zoe Wanamaker</b></p>
      <p><img src="../images/the-villians/lady-cassandra.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt=""/>Lady Cassandra O'Brien.Î”17 (pronounced &quot;dot delta seventeen&quot;), or simply Lady Cassandra, was a former human in the far future. Along with other rich and powerful people of the universe, Cassandra was on Platform One, a space station orbiting Earth in the year 5,000,000,000, set to witness the destruction of the planet by the expansion of the Sun.<br>
        </p>
      <p>According to Cassandra, her father, a Texan, and her mother, who came from the Arctic Desert, were the last to be buried in Earth's soil. She was born a male on Earth and lived on the edge of the &quot;Los Angeles Crevasse&quot;.<br>
        </p>
      <p>Cassandra, who was probably an aristocrat, was very elitist and &quot;looked down her nose&quot; at the Working-class Rose Tyler, whom she considered &quot;common&quot;.</p>
